SQL Schema Updater

So, what this is meant to do basically is this:

Say you had a SQL dump from some DB.
It looks like this:
CREATE TABLE someData(column1 TEXT, column2 TEXT, column3 TEXT);
INSERT INTO someData VALUES ('LALA', 'SAVES', 'THE DAY');
INSERT INTO someData VALUES ('Woah', 'Nelly', 'Settle Down');

Let's say you wanted to change the schema of that DB to this:
CREATE TABLE someData(column1, column3, column4);

Then you would run
schemaUpdate thatNewSchema.sql < theDump.sql

and it would spit out
INSERT INTO someData(column1, column3) VALUES ('LALA', 'THE DAY');
INSERT INTO someData(column1, column3) VALUES ('Woah', 'Settle Down');

Not terribly exciting, but it would work.
It has preserved all the data it could fit into this new DB.


Obviously this doesn't work if you're adding primary keys, or restraints of any kind.
It might simplify it, though.
It'd give you all that it can, then leave the rest up to you to do manually.

Also, it goes on strict names.
It doesn't deal in renamed columns, or renamed tables.
Again, though, it does the best it can.
You could easily modify its output by hand after, if you like.
